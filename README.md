## Key Features
>  Milestone 3 - Functional Cloud Environment: We first built a simple version of a serverless CRUD HTTP API to demonstrate a functional cloud environment for a healthcare use case. 
>  Milestone 4 - Cloud Security Solutions: We expanded upon our first HTTP API by building a CRUD REST API using Lambda and modeling access controls using Cognito for added security. 

## Setup Requirements 
> Access to AWS Console with extended permissions to ensure access to Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Artifact, and Amazon CloudWatch 
> Familiarity with Python and JSON objects, SQL syntax is a bonus 
> Knowledge of cURL and Postman API Platform for testing
