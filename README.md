# Brigid-Tracy-Cloud-Security 
Cloud Security Project on Serverless Computing with AWS Lambda and Access Controls with Amazon Cognito 

## Project Overview
* We used 6 AWS resources to create a secure, HIPAA-eligible healthcare app in 5 steps.

* Cognito and Artifact/Steps 1 and 5: [Milestone 4 - Lab 1: Cognito Set Up for User Authentication and Authorization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCBEKJPd4ho-lqnH4C2a_wHFsHuWWBJhsvhqNZYkNeU/edit?usp=sharing)
* Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch/Steps 2-4: [Milestone 4 - Lab 2: Building a REST API (CRUD) with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB Using Python for PHI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166ZWAWLxrEKU8s3tyN7V-sGcNZibDtDoYRSkYq5uSYs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Key Features
*  Milestone 3 - Functional Cloud Environment: We first built a simple version of a serverless CRUD HTTP API to demonstrate a functional cloud environment for a healthcare use case. 
*  Milestone 4 - Cloud Security Solutions: We expanded upon our first HTTP API by building a CRUD REST API using Lambda and modeling access controls using Cognito for added security. 

## Setup Requirements 
* Access to AWS Console with extended permissions to ensure access to the following HIPAA eligible services: 
> * Amazon Cognito
> * AWS Lambda
> * Amazon API Gateway
> * Amazon DynamoDB
> * AWS Artifact
> * Amazon CloudWatch 
* Familiarity with Python and JSON objects, SQL syntax is a bonus 
* Knowledge of cURL and Postman API Platform for testing
